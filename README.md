# The Green Path
## A Practical And No-nonsense Path To Programmer, Stakeholder and End User Happiness

"Software testing is nothing but an art of investigating software to ensure that its quality under test is in line with the requirement of the client."

To test, or not to test? That is not the question to ask. 

All software will inevitably be tested. Either by the people involved in creating it, or by the people using it. What I would like you to consider is this: how much will it cost you (with "you" I mean you personally or your company/organization/team) if the end-users of your system experience flaws in your software while actually using it and potentially loosing real data or suffering through disruptions and down-time? The cost of end-users experiencing flaws in software while using it can be incredibly high. Companies can lose customers, profits, and reputation due to software that fails to meet expectations. Software-related issues can cost companies time and money in terms of resources needed to resolve the issue, as well as lost productivity.
